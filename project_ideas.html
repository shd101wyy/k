          <h1>Project Ideas</h1>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            K is a framework for designing new programming languages and
            formalizing existing ones. K is unique in that the framework scales
            to very large languages like C (see the C semantics project) and has
            good tool support (see the K tool). To get a quick taste of K, see
            our 5-minute demo. To understand it better, do the K Tutorial. For
            an overview of the tool, see The K Primer (version 2.5); for a
            theoretical overview, see An Overview of the K Semantic Framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page lists project ideas related to the K framework. Although
            this page was initially created for Google Summer of Code students,
            it is applicable to any student interested in working with K.
            Students viewing this page will also be interested in the current
            list of projects using K and the GSoC2013 information page.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Remember</strong>: Students are not limited to projects on
            this list! We encourage students to submit proposals for their own
            ideas. We also encourage students to discuss their ideas with us
            before submitting a proposal, either via IRC (#fsl on freenode) or
            our mailing list.
          </p>

          <h3>Structure of the Ideas list</h3>
          <p>
            Besides a description, each project below has some additional
            information to help students select a project.
          </p>
          <h4>Color</h4>
          <p>
            <span style="color: green;">Green projects</span> are primarily
            coding projects and don't require much theoretical background to get
            started.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="color: blue;">Blue projects</span> are like green
            projects, except require more theoretical background and theoretical
            insights. These projects may require you to read a paper or two.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="color: red;">Red projects</span> are potential research
            directions but are too large and complex for GSoC. They are included
            to give a flavor of future directions of our work.
          </p>

          <h4>Scale</h4>
          <p>
            Most project ideas also specify a Scale. The following Scales are
            used (assuming the student is working on the project full-time):
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Summer</strong>: The project can definitely be completed
            over the summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Summer+</strong>: The project can be completed over the
            summer by an ambitious student.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Summer++</strong>: The project will require extra time
            beyond the summer to fully complete, but a usable portion of the
            project can be completed over the summer.
          </p>

          <h4>Prerequisite experience</h4>
          <p>
            For each project idea there is some implicit prerequisite
            experience. All of the projects require a minimum understanding of
            what K is, its goals, and the structure of the tool. Tool developers
            will need to know Java and how to work with ASTs in Java, but will
            not need to be as familiar with the theory or features of K.
            Developers of K definitions wont need to know Java, but will need to
            become more familiar with the theory and features of K. Projects may
            have additional experience prerequisites specified below.
          </p>

          <h4>Probable mentors</h4>
          <p>
            Most project ideas specify a list of people that are likely to
            mentor the project. See the <a href="./people.html">People</a> page
            for a list of potential mentors for all projects and links to their
            homepages. Note that a project idea without mentors does not mean
            that there are no mentors available for the project; it means the
            mentors will be assigned based on the student's proposal.
          </p>

          <h2>Ideas</h2>
          <h3>User interfaces</h3>
          <h4>Eclipse IDE</h4>
          <p>
            Integrate the K Semantic Framework with Eclipse to make the
            framework more accessible and user-friendly. Features we would like
            in the K/Eclipse IDE include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ability to edit, compile, and execute semantics without ever
              having to leave Eclipse. This would require integration with the
              compile scripts and the K backends. One possibility is to embed
              the Maude interpreter into Eclipse.
            </li>
            <li>Syntax highlighting for K modules.</li>
            <li>
              When typing a cell start tag like "<k>", the end tag "</k>" should
              automatically be inserted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Autocompletion for cell names, sorts, operators, module names,
              etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Integration with static analysis tools. For example, the IDE
              should add yellow "warning" underlines to indicate named variables
              on the LHS of a rule that are not used in the RHS.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div><strong>Scale</strong>: Summer+</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Prerequisite experience</strong>: Java. Familiarity with
            developing Eclipse plug-ins. UI design experience.
          </div>
          <div><strong>Probable mentors</strong>: Grigore, Dorel</div>

          <br />
          <h4>Web interface for K</h4>
          <p>
            A web interface for K allows users to learn about and use K without
            having to install it first. Improve the existing online web
            interface or (preferably) create a new online interface from
            scratch. One possibility is to emulate a terminal in the browser
            that accepts commands that are identical to the commands that would
            be used to run K locally.
          </p>
          <div><strong>Scale</strong>: Summer</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Prerequisite experience</strong>: Web programming
            experience.
          </div>
          <div><strong>Probable mentors</strong>: Andrei, David</div>

          <br />
          <h4>GUI for creating programming languages</h4>
          <p>
            Due to the modularity of the K framework, language features (e.g.,
            side effects, exceptions, threads, continuations, type systems,
            etc.) can easily be added and removed from a language. Build a GUI
            that exposes this modularity by letting users create custom
            programming languages easily. One possibility is to create an
            interface which allows language features to be combined via
            drag-and-drop. Regardless, the GUI should support:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lots of language features</li>
            <li>Customizable syntax for every language feature</li>
            <li>Running programs in the custom language directly in the GUI</li>
            <li>Any other features you may think of</li>
          </ul>
          <div><b>Scale</b>: Summer++</div>
          <div><b>Prerequisite experience</b>: UI design experience.</div>
          <div><b>Probable mentors</b>>: Grigore</div>

          <br />
          <h3>Derived tools</h3>
          <p>
            Multiple tools can be automatically derived from a single K
            definition of a language:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Interpreter: given a program, execute it</li>
            <li>
              State space search tool: given a program, search for all of its
              possible behaviors
            </li>
            <li>
              Debugger: given a program, step through its execution with
              breakpoints, watchpoints, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Definedness checker: given a program, determine whether it is
              defined or not according to the semantics
            </li>
            <li>
              Coverage checker: given a program or a collection of programs,
              determine how frequently each K rule is used to execute the
              program(s). This is used to check the coverage of a compiler's
              test suite.
            </li>
            <li>
              Profiler: given a program, run it and determine which rules are
              executed most often and which take the most time
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The following projects involve improving these tools and making them
            general enough to work with all K definitions.
          </p>

          <h4>Interpreter</h4>
          <p>
            The krun tool allows a K definition to be used as an interpreter and
            state space search tool for the language it defines. For example,
            the command krun collatz.imp executes the collatz program using the
            definition of the IMP language. The goal of this project is to fix
            bugs and add features to the (Java version) of krun. One possible
            task is to add support for querying cells in the output
            configuration using XPath.
