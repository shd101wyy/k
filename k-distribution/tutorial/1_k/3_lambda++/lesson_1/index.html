<p>Here we add <em>call-with-current-continuation</em> (<code>callcc</code>) to the definition of
LAMBDA completed in Tutorial 1, and call the resulting language LAMBDA++.
While doing so, we will learn how to define language constructs that
abruptly change the execution control flow.</p>
<p>Take over the <code>lambda.k</code> definition from Lesson 8 in Part 1 of this Tutorial,
which is the complete definition of the LAMBDA language, but without the
comments.</p>
<p><code>callcc</code> is a good example for studying the capabilities of a framework to
support abrupt changes of control, because it is one of the most
control-intensive language constructs known.  Scheme is probably the first
programming language that incorporated the <code>callcc</code> construct, although
similar constructs have been recently included in many other languages in
one form or another.</p>
<p>Here is a quick description: <code>callcc e</code> passes the remaining computation
context, packaged as a function <code>k</code>, to <code>e</code> (which is expected to be a function);
if during its evaluation <code>e</code> passes any value to <code>k</code>, then the current
execution context is discarded and replaced by the one encoded by <code>k</code> and
the value is passed to it; if <code>e</code> evaluates normally to some value <code>v</code> and
passes nothing to <code>k</code> in the process, then <code>v</code> is returned as a result of
<code>callcc e</code> and the execution continues normally.  For example, we want the
program <code>callcc-jump.lambda</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(callcc (lambda k . ((k 5) + 2))) + 10
</code></pre>
<p>to evaluate to <code>15</code>, not <code>17</code>!  Indeed, the computation context <code>[] + 10</code> is
passed to <code>callcc</code>&apos;s argument, which then sends it a <code>5</code>, so the computation
resumes to <code>5 + 10</code>.  On the other hand, the program <code>callcc-not-jump.lambda</code></p>
<pre><code>(callcc (lambda k . (5 + 2))) + 10
</code></pre>
<p>evaluates to <code>17</code>.</p>
<p>If you like playing games, you can metaphorically think of <code>callcc e</code> as
<em>saving your game state in a file and passing it to your friend <code>e</code></em>.
Then <code>e</code> can decide at some moment to drop everything she was doing, load
your game and continue to play it from where you were.</p>
<p>The behavior of many popular control-changing constructs can be obtained
using <code>callcc</code>.  The program <code>callcc-return.lambda</code> shows, for example, how to
obtain the behavior of a <code>return</code> statement, which exits the current execution
context inside a function and returns a value to the caller&apos;s context:</p>
<pre><code>letrec f x = callcc (lambda return . (
  f (if (x &lt;= 0) then ((return 1) / 0) else 2)
))
in (f -3)
</code></pre>
<p>This should evaluate to <code>1</code>, in spite of the recursive call to <code>f</code>
and of the division by zero!  Note that <code>return</code> is nothing but a variable
name, but one which is bound to the current continuation at the beginning of
the function execution.  As soon as <code>1</code> is passed to <code>return</code>, the computation
jumps <em>back in time</em> to where <code>callcc</code> was defined! Change <code>-3</code> to <code>3</code> and the
program will loop forever.</p>
<p><code>callcc</code> is quite a powerful and beautiful language construct, although one
which is admittedly hard to give semantics to in some frameworks.
But not in K :)  Here is the entire K syntax and semantics of <code>callcc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>syntax Exp ::= &quot;callcc&quot; Exp  [strict]
syntax Val ::= cc(K)
rule &lt;k&gt; (callcc V:Val =&gt; V cc(K)) ~&gt; K &lt;/k&gt;
rule &lt;k&gt; cc(K) V ~&gt; _ =&gt;  V ~&gt; K &lt;/k&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Let us first discuss the annotated syntax.  We declared <code>callcc</code> strict,
because its argument may not necessarily be a function yet, so it may need
to be evaluated.  As explained above, we need to encode the remaining
computation somehow and pass it to <code>callcc</code>&apos;s argument.  More specifically,
since LAMBDA is call-by-value, we have to encode the remaining computation as
a value.  We do not want to simply subsort computations to <code>Val</code>, because there
are computations which we do not want to be values.  A simple solution to
achieve our goal here is to introduce a new value construct, say <code>cc</code> (from
<em>current-continuation</em>), which holds any computation.</p>
<p>Note that, inspired from <a href="http://www.program-transformation.org/Sdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDF</a>,
K allows you to define the syntax of helping semantic operations, like <code>cc</code>,
more compactly.  Typically, we do not need a fancy syntax for such operators;
all we need is a name, followed by open parenthesis, followed by a
comma-separated list of arguments, followed by closed parenthesis.  If this
is the syntax that you want for a particular construct, then K allows you to
drop all the quotes surrounding the terminals, as we did above for <code>cc</code>.</p>
<p>The semantic rules do exactly what the English semantics of <code>callcc</code> says.
Note that here, unlike in our definition of LAMBDA in Tutorial 1, we had
to mention the cell <code>&lt;k/&gt;</code> in our rules.  This is because we need to make sure
that we match the entire remaining computation, not only a fragment of it!
For example, if we replace the two rules above with</p>
<pre><code>rule (callcc V:Val =&gt; V cc(K)) ~&gt; K
rule cc(K) V ~&gt; _ =&gt;  V ~&gt; K
</code></pre>
<p>then we get a <code>callcc</code> which is allowed to non-deterministically pick a
prefix of the remaining computation and pass it to its argument, and then
when invoked within its argument, a non-deterministic prefix of the new
computation is discarded and replaced by the saved one.  Wow, that would
be quite a language!  Would you like to write programs in it?  :)</p>
<p>Consequently, in K we can abruptly change the execution control flow of a
program by simply changing the contents of the <code>&lt;k/&gt;</code> cell.  This is one of
the advantages of having an explicit representation of the execution context,
like in K or in reduction semantics with evaluation contexts.  Constructs like
<code>callcc</code> are very hard and non-elegant to define in frameworks such as SOS,
because those implicitly represent the execution context as proof context,
and the latter cannot be easily changed.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to handle cells in configurations and use them in rules,
in the next lesson we take a fresh look at LAMBDA and define it using
an environment-based style, which avoids the complexity of substitution
(e.g., having to deal with variable capture) and is closer in spirit to how
functional languages are implemented.</p>
