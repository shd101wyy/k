<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This is the <strong>K</strong> semantic definition of the untyped SIMPLE language.
SIMPLE is intended to be a pedagogical and research language that captures
the essence of the imperative programming paradigm, extended with several
features often encountered in imperative programming languages.
A program consists of a set of global variable declarations and
function definitions.  Like in C, function definitions cannot be
nested and each program must have one function called <code>main</code>,
which is invoked when the program is executed.  To make it more
interesting and to highlight some of <strong>K</strong>&apos;s strengths, SIMPLE includes
the following features in addition to the conventional imperative
expression and statement constructs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multidimensional arrays and array references.  An array evaluates
to an array reference, which is a special value holding a location (where
the elements of the array start) together with the size of the array;
the elements of the array can be array references themselves (particularly
when the array is multi-dimensional).  Array references are ordinary values,
so they can be assigned to variables and passed/received by functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functions and function values.  Functions can have zero or
more parameters and can return abruptly using a <code>return</code> statement.
SIMPLE follows a call-by-value parameter passing style, with static scoping.
Function names evaluate to function abstractions, which hereby become ordinary
values in the language, same like the array references.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blocks with locals.  SIMPLE variables can be declared
anywhere, their scope being from the place where they are declared
until the end of the most nested enclosing block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Input/Output.  The expression <code>read()</code> evaluates to the
next value in the input buffer, and the statement <code>write(e)</code>
evaluates <code>e</code> and outputs its value to the output buffer.  The
input and output buffers are lists of values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exceptions.  SIMPLE has parametric exceptions (the value thrown as
an exception can be caught and bound).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concurrency via dynamic thread creation/termination and
synchronization.  One can spawn a thread to execute any statement.
The spawned thread shares with its parent its environment at creation time.
Threads can be synchronized via a join command which blocks the current thread
until the joined thread completes, via re-entrant locks which can be acquired
and released, as well as through rendezvous commands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like in many other languages, some of SIMPLE&apos;s constructs can be
desugared into a smaller set of basic constructs.  We do that at the end
of the syntax module, and then we only give semantics to the core constructs.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This definition is commented slightly more than others, because it is
intended to be one of the first non-trivial definitions that the new
user of <strong>K</strong> sees.  We recommend the beginner user to first check the
language definitions discussed in the <strong>K</strong> tutorial.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">module</span> SIMPLE-UNTYPED-SYNTAX<span class="hljs-keyword">
  imports</span> DOMAINS-SYNTAX
</code></pre>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>We start by defining the SIMPLE syntax.  The language constructs discussed
above have the expected syntax and evaluation strategies.  Recall that in <strong>K</strong>
we annotate the syntax with appropriate strictness attributes, thus giving
each language construct the desired evaluation strategy.</p>
<h2>Identifiers</h2>
<p>Recall from the <strong>K</strong> tutorial that identifiers are builtin and come under the
syntactic category <code>Id</code>.  The special identifier for the function
<code>main</code> belongs to all programs, and plays a special role in the semantics,
so we declare it explicitly.  This would not be necessary if the identifiers
were all included automatically in semantic definitions, but that is not
possible because of parsing reasons (e.g., <strong>K</strong> variables used to match
concrete identifiers would then be ambiguously parsed as identifiers).  They
are only included in the parser generated to parse programs (and used by the
<code>kast</code> tool).  Consequently, we have to explicitly declare all the
concrete identifiers that play a special role in the semantics, like
<code>main</code> below.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  syntax</span><span class="hljs-keyword"> Id</span> ::= <span class="hljs-string">&quot;main&quot;</span> [<span class="hljs-literal">token</span>]
</code></pre>
<h2>Declarations</h2>
<p>There are two types of declarations: for variables (including arrays) and
for functions.  We are going to allow declarations of the form
<code>var x=10, a[10,10], y=23;</code>, which is why we allow the <code>var</code>
keyword to take a list of expressions.  The non-terminals used in the two
productions below are defined shortly.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  syntax</span> Decl ::= <span class="hljs-string">&quot;var&quot;</span> Exps <span class="hljs-string">&quot;;&quot;</span>
                | <span class="hljs-string">&quot;function&quot;</span><span class="hljs-keyword"> Id</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;(&quot;</span> Ids <span class="hljs-string">&quot;)&quot;</span> Block
</code></pre>
<h2>Expressions</h2>
<p>The expression constructs below are standard.  Increment (<code>++</code>) takes
an expression rather than a variable because it can also increment an array
element.  Recall that the syntax we define in <strong>K</strong> is what we call <em>the syntax
of the semantics</em>: while powerful enough to define non-trivial syntaxes
(thanks to the underlying SDF technology that we use), we typically refrain
from defining precise syntaxes, that is, ones which accept precisely the
well-formed programs (that would not be possible anyway in general).  That job
is deferred to type systems, which can also be defined in <strong>K</strong>.  In other words,
we are not making any effort to guarantee syntactically that only variables
or array elements are passed to the increment construct, we allow any
expression.  Nevertheless, we will only give semantics to those, so expressions
of the form <code>++5</code>, which parse (but which will be rejected by our type
system in the typed version of SIMPLE later), will get stuck when executed.
Arrays can be multidimensional and can hold other arrays, so their
lookup operation takes a list of expressions as argument and applies to an
expression (which can in particular be another array lookup), respectively.
The construct <code>sizeOf</code> gives the size of an array in number of elements
of its first dimension.  Note that almost all constructs are strict.  The only
constructs which are not strict are the increment (since its first argument
gets updated, so it cannot be evaluated), the input read which takes no
arguments so strictness is irrelevant for it, the logical and and or constructs
which are short-circuited, the thread spawning construct which creates a new
thread executing the argument expression and return its unique identifier to
the creating thread (so it cannot just evaluate its argument in place), and the
assignment which is only strict in its second argument (for the same reason as
the increment).</p>

</code></pre>
<p>We also need comma-separated lists of identifiers and of expressions.
Moreover, we want them to be strict, that is, to evaluate to lists of results
whenever requested (e.g., when they appear as strict arguments of
the constructs above).</p>

  syntax</span> Ids ::= Bottoms
</code></pre>
<h2>Statements</h2>
<p>Most of the statement constructs are standard for imperative languages.
We syntactically distinguish between empty and non-empty blocks, because we
chose <code>Stmts</code> not to be a (<code>;</code>-separated) list of
<code>Stmt</code>.  Variables can be declared anywhere inside a block, their scope
ending with the block.  Expressions are allowed to be used for their side
effects only (followed by a semicolon <code>;</code>).  Functions are allowed
to abruptly return.  The exceptions are parametric, i.e., one can throw a value
which is bound to the variable declared by <code>catch</code>.  Threads can be
dynamically created and terminated, and can synchronize with <code>join</code>,
<code>acquire</code>, <code>release</code> and <code>rendezvous</code>.  Note that the
strictness attributes obey the intended evaluation strategy of the various
constructs.  In particular, the if-then-else construct is strict only in its
first argument (the if-then construct will be desugared into if-then-else),
while the loop constructs are not strict in any arguments.  The <code>print</code>
statement construct is variadic, that is, it takes an arbitrary number of
arguments.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The reason we allow <code>Stmts</code> as the first argument of <code>for</code>
instead of <code>Stmt</code> is because we want to allow more than one statement
to be executed when the loop is initialized.  Also, as seens shorly, macros
may expand one statement into more statements; for example, an initialized
variable declaration statement <code>var x=0;</code> desugars into two statements,
namely <code>var x; x=0;</code>, so if we use <code>Stmt</code> instead of <code>Stmts</code>
in the production of <code>for</code> above then we risk that the macro expansion
of statement <code>var x=0;</code> happens before the macro expansion of <code>for</code>,
also shown below, in which case the latter would not apply anymore because
of syntactic mismatch.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  syntax</span> Stmts ::= Stmt

<h2>Desugared Syntax</h2>
<p>This part desugars some of SIMPLE&apos;s language constructs into core ones.
We only want to give semantics to core constructs, so we get rid of the
derived ones before we start the semantics.  All desugaring macros below are
straightforward.</p>

<p>For the semantics, we can therefore assume from now on that each
conditional has both branches, that there are only <code>while</code> loops, and
that each variable is declared alone and without any initialization as part of
the declaration.</p>

<h2>Basic Semantic Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Before one starts adding semantic rules to a <strong>K</strong> definition, one needs to
define the basic semantic infrastructure consisting of definitions for
<code>values</code> and <code>configuration</code>.  As discussed in the definitions
in the <strong>K</strong> tutorial, the values are needed to know when to stop applying
the heating rules and when to start applying the cooling rules corresponding
to strictness or context declarations.  The configuration serves as a backbone
for the process of configuration abstraction which allows users to only
mention the relevant cells in each semantic rule, the rest of the configuration
context being inferred automatically.  Although in some cases the configuration
could be automatically inferred from the rules, we believe that it is very
useful for language designers/semanticists to actually think of and design
their configuration explicitly, so the current implementation of <strong>K</strong> requires
one to define it.</p>
<h2>Values</h2>
<p>We here define the values of the language that the various fragments of
programs evaluate to.  First, integers and Booleans are values.  As discussed,
arrays evaluate to special array reference values holding (1) a location from
where the array&apos;s elements are contiguously allocated in the store, and
(2) the size of the array.  Functions evaluate to function values as
&#x3BB;-abstractions (we do not need to evaluate functions to closures
because each function is executed in the fixed global environment and
function definitions cannot be nested).  Like in IMP and other
languages, we finally tell the tool that values are <strong>K</strong> results.</p>

                   | Vals  <span class="hljs-comment">// <span class="hljs-doctag">TODO:</span> should not need this</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The inclusion of values in expressions follows the methodology of
syntactic definitions (like, e.g., in SOS): extend the syntax of the language
to encompass all values and additional constructs needed to give semantics.
In addition to that, it allows us to write the semantic rules using the
original syntax of the language, and to parse them with the same (now extended
with additional values) parser.  If writing the semantics directly on the <strong>K</strong>
AST, using the associated labels instead of the syntactic constructs, then one
would not need to include values in expressions.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The <strong>K</strong> configuration of SIMPLE consists of a top level cell, <code>T</code>,
holding a <code>threads</code> cell, a global environment map cell <code>genv</code>
mapping the global variables and function names to their locations, a shared
store map cell <code>store</code> mapping each location to some value, a set cell
<code>busy</code> holding the locks which have been acquired but not yet released
by threads, a set cell <code>terminated</code> holding the unique identifiers of
the threads which already terminated (needed for <code>join</code>), <code>input</code>
and <code>output</code> list cells, and a <code>nextLoc</code> cell holding a natural
number indicating the next available location.  Unlike in the small languages
in the <strong>K</strong> tutorial, where we used the fresh predicate to generate fresh
locations, in larger languages, like SIMPLE, we prefer to explicitly manage
memory.  The location counter in <code>nextLoc</code> models an actual physical
location in the store; for simplicity, we assume arbitrarily large memory and
no garbage collection.  The <code>threads</code> cell contains one <code>thread</code>
cell for each existing thread in the program.  Note that the thread cell has
multiplicity <code>*</code>, which means that at any given moment there could be zero,
one or more <code>thread</code> cells.  Each <code>thread</code> cell contains a
computation cell <code>k</code>, a <code>control</code> cell holding the various
control structures needed to jump to certain points of interest in the program
execution, a local environment map cell <code>env</code> mapping the thread local
variables to locations in the store, and finally a <code>holds</code> map cell
indicating what locks have been acquired by the thread and not released so far
and how many times (SIMPLE&apos;s locks are re-entrant).  The <code>control</code> cell
currently contains only two subcells, a function stack <code>fstack</code> which
is a list and an exception stack <code>xstack</code> which is also a list.
One can add more control structures in the <code>control</code> cell, such as a
stack for break/continue of loops, etc., if the language is extended with more
control-changing constructs.  Note that all cells except for <code>k</code> are
also initialized, in that they contain a ground term of their corresponding
sort.  The <code>k</code> cell is initialized with the program that will be passed
to the <strong>K</strong> tool, as indicated by the <code>$PGM</code> variable, followed by the
<code>execute</code> task (defined shortly).</p>

</code></pre>
<h2>Declarations and Initialization</h2>
<p>We start by defining the semantics of declarations (for variables,
arrays and functions).</p>
<h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
<p>The SIMPLE syntax was desugared above so that each variable is
declared alone and its initialization is done as a separate statement.
The semantic rule below matches resulting variable declarations of the
form <code>var X;</code> on top of the <code>k</code> cell
(indeed, note that the <code>k</code> cell is complete, or round, to the
left, and is torn, or ruptured, to the right), allocates a fresh
location <code>L</code> in the store which is initialized with a special value
<code>&#x22A5;</code> (indeed, the unit <code>.</code>, or nothing, is matched anywhere
in the map &#x2012;note the tears at both sides&#x2012; and replaced with the
mapping <code>L &#x21A6; &#x22A5;</code>), and binds <code>X</code> to <code>L</code> in the local
environment shadowing previous declarations of <code>X</code>, if any.
This possible shadowing of <code>X</code> requires us to therefore update the
entire environment map, which is expensive and can significantly slow
down the execution of larger programs.  On the other hand, since we know
that <code>L</code> is not already bound in the store, we simply add the binding
<code>L &#x21A6; &#x22A5;</code> to the store, thus avoiding a potentially complete
traversal of the the store map in order to update it.  We prefer the approach
used for updating the store whenever possible, because, in addition to being
faster, it offers more true concurrency than the latter; indeed, according
to the concurrent semantics of <code>K</code>, the store is not frozen while
<code>L &#x21A6; &#x22A5;</code> is added to it, while the environment is frozen during the
update operation <code>Env[L/X]</code>.  The variable declaration command is
also removed from the top of the computation cell and the fresh location
counter is incremented.  The undefined symbol <code>&#x22A5;</code> added in the store
is of sort <code>KItem</code>, instead of <code>Val</code>, on purpose; this way, the
store lookup rules will get stuck when one attempts to lookup an
uninitialized location.  All the above happen in one transactional step,
with the rule below.  Note also how configuration abstraction allows us to
only mention the needed cells; indeed, as the configuration above states,
the <code>k</code> and <code>env</code> cells are actually located within a
<code>thread</code> cell within the <code>threads</code> cell, but one needs
not mention these: the configuration context of the rule is
automatically transformed to match the declared configuration
structure.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  syntax</span> KItem ::= <span class="hljs-string">&quot;undefined&quot;</span>  [<span class="hljs-literal">latex</span>(\bot)]<span class="hljs-keyword">

       &lt;nextLoc&gt; L =&gt; L +<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> &lt;/nextLoc&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Array Declaration</h2>
<p>The <strong>K</strong> semantics of the uni-dimensional array declaration is somehow similar
to the above declaration of ordinary variables.  First, note the
context declaration below, which requests the evaluation of the array
dimension.  Once evaluated, say to a natural number <code>N</code>, then
<code>N +Int 1</code> locations are allocated in the store for
an array of size <code>N</code>, the additional location (chosen to be the first
one allocated) holding the array reference value.  The array reference
value <code>array(L,N)</code> states that the array has size <code>N</code> and its
elements are located contiguously in the store starting with location
<code>L</code>.  The operation <code>L &#x2026; L&apos; &#x21A6; V</code>, defined at the end of this
file in the auxiliary operation section, initializes each location in
the list <code>L &#x2026; L&apos;</code> to <code>V</code>.  Note that, since the dimensions of
array declarations can be arbitrary expressions, this virtually means
that we can dynamically allocate memory in SIMPLE by means of array
declarations.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>SIMPLE allows multi-dimensional arrays.  For semantic simplicity, we
desugar them all into uni-dimensional arrays by code transformation.
This way, we only need to give semantics to uni-dimensional arrays.
First, note that the context rule above actually evaluates all the array
dimensions (that&apos;s why we defined the expression lists strict!):
Upon evaluating the array dimensions, the code generation rule below
desugars multi-dimensional array declaration to uni-dimensional declarations.
To this aim, we introduce two special unique variable identifiers,
<code>$1</code> and <code>$2</code>.  The first variable, <code>$1</code>, iterates
through and initializes each element of the first dimension with an array
of the remaining dimensions, declared as variable <code>$2</code>:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  syntax</span><span class="hljs-keyword"> Id</span> ::= <span class="hljs-string">&quot;$1&quot;</span> | <span class="hljs-string">&quot;$2&quot;</span><span class="hljs-keyword">
  rule</span> var X:<span class="hljs-keyword">Id</span>[N1:<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span>, N2:<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span>, Vs:Vals];
    =&gt; var X[N1];
       {
         for(var $<span class="hljs-number">1</span> = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; $<span class="hljs-number">1</span> &lt;= N1 - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; ++$<span class="hljs-number">1</span>) {
           var $<span class="hljs-number">2</span>[N2, Vs];
           X[$<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = $<span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
         }
       }
    [<span class="hljs-literal">structural</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, one would like to perform syntactic desugarings like the one
above before the actual semantics.  Unfortunately, that was not possible in
this case because the dimension expressions of the multi-dimensional array need
to be evaluated first.  Indeed, the desugaring rule above does not work if the
dimensions of the declared array are arbitrary expressions, because they can
have side effects (e.g., <code>a[++x,++x]</code>) and those side effects would be
propagated each time the expression is evaluated in the desugaring code (note
that both the loop condition and the nested multi-dimensional declaration
would need to evaluate the expressions given as array dimensions).</p>
<h2>Function declaration</h2>
<p>Functions are evaluated to &#x3BB;-abstractions and stored like any other
values in the store.  A binding is added into the environment for the function
name to the location holding its body.  Similarly to the C language, SIMPLE
only allows function declarations at the top level of the program.  More
precisely, the subsequent semantics of SIMPLE only works well when one
respects this requirement.  Indeed, the simplistic context-free parser
generated by the grammar above is more generous than we may want, in that it
allows function declarations anywhere any declaration is allowed, including
inside arbitrary blocks.  However, as the rule below shows, we are <code>not</code>
storing the declaration environment with the &#x3BB;-abstraction value as
closures do.  Instead, as seen shortly, we switch to the global environment
whenever functions are invoked, which is consistent with our requirement that
functions should only be declared at the top.  Thus, if one declares local
functions, then one may see unexpected behaviors (e.g., when one shadows a
global variable before declaring a local function).  The type checker of
SIMPLE, also defined in <strong>K</strong> (see <code>examples/simple/typed/static</code>),
discards programs which do not respect this requirement.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; function F(Xs) S =&gt; . ...&lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;env&gt; Env =&gt; Env[F &lt;- L] &lt;/env&gt;
       &lt;store&gt;... .Map =&gt; L |-&gt; lambda(Xs, S) ...&lt;/store&gt;
       &lt;nextLoc&gt; L =&gt; L +<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> &lt;/nextLoc&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When we are done with the first pass (pre-processing), the computation
cell <code>k</code> contains only the token <code>execute</code> (see the configuration
declaration above, where the computation item <code>execute</code> was placed
right after the program in the <code>k</code> cell of the initial configuration)
and the cell <code>genv</code> is empty.  In this case, we have to call
<code>main()</code> and to initialize the global environment by transferring the
contents of the local environment into it.  We prefer to do it this way, as
opposed to processing all the top level declarations directly within the global
environment, because we want to avoid duplication of semantics: the syntax of
the global declarations is identical to that of their corresponding local
declarations, so the semantics of the latter suffices provided that we copy
the local environment into the global one once we are done with the
pre-processing.  We want this separate pre-processing step precisely because
we want to create the global environment.  All (top-level) functions end up
having their names bound in the global environment and, as seen below, they
are executed in that same global environment; all these mean, in particular,
that the functions &quot;see&quot; each other, allowing for mutual recursion, etc.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  syntax</span> KItem ::= <span class="hljs-string">&quot;execute&quot;</span><span class="hljs-keyword">

       &lt;env&gt; Env &lt;/env&gt;
       &lt;genv&gt; .Map =&gt; Env &lt;/genv&gt;  [<span class="hljs-literal">structural</span>]
</code></pre>
<h2>Expressions</h2>
<p>We next define the <strong>K</strong> semantics of all the expression constructs.</p>
<h2>Variable lookup</h2>
<p>When a variable <code>X</code> is the first computational task, and <code>X</code> is bound to some
location <code>L</code> in the environment, and <code>L</code> is mapped to some value <code>V</code> in the
store, then we rewrite <code>X</code> into <code>V</code>:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; X:<span class="hljs-keyword">Id</span> =&gt; V ...&lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;env&gt;... X |-&gt; L ...&lt;/env&gt;
       &lt;store&gt;... L |-&gt; V:Val ...&lt;/store&gt;  [lookup]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the rule above excludes reading <code>&#x22A5;</code>, because <code>&#x22A5;</code> is not
a value and <code>V</code> is checked at runtime to be a value.</p>
<h2>Variable/Array increment</h2>
<p>This is tricky, because we want to allow both <code>++x</code> and <code>++a[5]</code>.
Therefore, we need to extract the lvalue of the expression to increment.
To do that, we state that the expression to increment should be wrapped
by the auxiliary <code>lvalue</code> operation and then evaluated.  The semantics
of this auxiliary operation is defined at the end of this file.  For now, all
we need to know is that it takes an expression and evaluates to a location
value.  Location values, also defined at the end of the file, are integers
wrapped with the operation <code>loc</code>, to distinguish them from ordinary
integers.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  context</span> ++(HOLE =&gt; lvalue(HOLE))<span class="hljs-keyword">
  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; ++loc(L) =&gt; I +<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> ...&lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;store&gt;... L |-&gt; (I =&gt; I +<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) ...&lt;/store&gt;  [increment]
</code></pre>
<h2>Arithmetic operators</h2>
<p>There is nothing special about the following rules.  They rewrite the
language constructs to their library counterparts when their arguments
become values of expected sorts:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> I1 + I2 =&gt; I1 +<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span> I2<span class="hljs-keyword">

</code></pre>
<p>The equality and inequality constructs reduce to syntactic comparison
of the two argument values (which is what the equality on <code>K</code> terms does).</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> V1:Val == V2:Val =&gt; V1 ==K V2<span class="hljs-keyword">

<h2>Array lookup</h2>
<p>Untyped SIMPLE does not check array bounds (the dynamically typed version of
it, in <code>examples/simple/typed/dynamic</code>, does check for array out of
bounds).  The first rule below desugars the multi-dimensional array access to
uni-dimensional array access; recall that the array access operation was
declared strict, so all sub-expressions involved are already values at this
stage.  The second rule rewrites the array access to a lookup operation at a
precise location; we prefer to do it this way to avoid locking the store.
The semantics of the auxiliary <code>lookup</code> operation is straightforward,
and is defined at the end of the file.</p>

</code></pre>
<h2>Size of an array</h2>
<p>The size of the array is stored in the array reference value, and the
<code>sizeOf</code> construct was declared strict, so:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> sizeOf(array(_,N)) =&gt; N
</code></pre>
<h2>Function call</h2>
<p>Function application was strict in both its arguments, so we can
assume that both the function and its arguments are evaluated to
values (the former expected to be a &#x3BB;-abstraction).  The first
rule below matches a well-formed function application on top of the
computation and performs the following steps atomically: it switches
to the function body followed by <code>return;</code> (for the case in
which the function does not use an explicit return statement); it
pushes the remaining computation, the current environment, and the
current control data onto the function stack (the remaining
computation can thus also be discarded from the computation cell,
because an unavoidable subsequent <code>return</code> statement &#x2012;see
above&#x2012; will always recover it from the stack); it switches the
current environment (which is being pushed on the function stack) to
the global environment, which is where the free variables in the
function body should be looked up; it binds the formal parameters to
fresh locations in the new environment, and stores the actual
arguments to those locations in the store (this latter step is easily
done by reducing the problem to variable declarations, whose semantics
we have already defined; the auxiliary operation <code>mkDecls</code> is
defined at the end of the file).  The second rule pops the
computation, the environment and the control data from the function
stack when a <code>return</code> statement is encountered as the next
computational task, passing the returned value to the popped
computation (the popped computation was the context in which the
returning function was called).  Note that the pushing/popping of the
control data is crucial.  Without it, one may have a function that
contains an exception block with a return statement inside, which
would put the <code>xstack</code> cell in an inconsistent state (since the
exception block modifies it, but that modification should be
irrelevant once the function returns).  We add an artificial
<code>nothing</code> value to the language, which is returned by the
nulary <code>return;</code> statements.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Like for division-by-zero, it is left unspecified what happens
when the <code>nothing</code> value is used in domain calculations.  For
example, from the the perspective of the language semantics,
<code>7 +Int nothing</code> can evaluate to anything, or
may not evaluate at all (be undefined).  If one wants to make sure that
such artificial values are never misused, then one needs to define a static
checker (also using <strong>K</strong>, like our the type checker in
<code>examples/simple/typed/static</code>) and reject programs that do.
Note that, unlike the undefined symbol <code>&#x22A5;</code> which had the sort <code>K</code>
instead of <code>Val</code>, we defined <code>nothing</code> to be a value.  That
is because, as explained above, we do not want the program to get
stuck when nothing is returned by a function.  Instead, we want the
behavior to be unspecified; in particular, if one is careful to never
use the returned value in domain computation, like it happens when we
call a function for its side effects (e.g., with a statement of the
form <code>f(x);</code>), then the program does not get stuck.</p>
<h2>Read</h2>
<p>The <code>read()</code> expression construct simply evaluates to the next
input value, at the same time discarding the input value from the
<code>in</code> cell.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; read() =&gt; I ...&lt;/k&gt; &lt;input&gt; ListItem(I:<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span>) =&gt; .List ...&lt;/input&gt;  [read]
</code></pre>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>In SIMPLE, like in C, assignments are expression constructs and not statement
constructs.  To make it a statement all one needs to do is to follow it by a
semi-colon <code>;</code> (see the semantics for expression statements below).
Like for the increment, we want to allow assignments not only to variables but
also to array elements, e.g., <code>e1[e2] = e3</code> where <code>e1</code> evaluates
to an array reference, <code>e2</code> to a natural number, and <code>e3</code> to any
value.  Thus, we first compute the lvalue of the left-hand-side expression
that appears in an assignment, and then we do the actual assignment to the
resulting location:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  context</span> (HOLE =&gt; lvalue(HOLE)) = _<span class="hljs-keyword">

  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; loc(L) = V:Val =&gt; V ...&lt;/k&gt; &lt;store&gt;... L |-&gt; (_ =&gt; V) ...&lt;/store&gt;
    [assignment]
</code></pre>
<h2>Statements</h2>
<p>We next define the <strong>K</strong> semantics of statements.</p>
<h2>Blocks</h2>
<p>Empty blocks are simply discarded, as shown in the first rule below.
For non-empty blocks, we schedule the enclosed statement but we have to
make sure the environment is recovered after the enclosed statement executes.
Recall that we allow local variable declarations, whose scope is the block
enclosing them.  That is the reason for which we have to recover the
environment after the block.  This allows us to have a very simple semantics
for variable declarations, as we did above.  One can make the two rules below
computational if one wants them to count as computational steps.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> {} =&gt; .  [<span class="hljs-literal">structural</span>]<span class="hljs-keyword">
  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; { S } =&gt; S ~&gt; setEnv(Env) ...&lt;/k&gt;  &lt;env&gt; Env &lt;/env&gt;  [<span class="hljs-literal">structural</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>The basic definition of environment recovery is straightforward and
given in the section on auxiliary constructs at the end of the file.</p>
<p>There are two common alternatives to the above semantics of blocks.
One is to keep track of the variables which are declared in the block and only
recover those at the end of the block.  This way one does more work for
variable declarations but conceptually less work for environment recovery; we
say <code>conceptually</code> because it is not clear that it is indeed the case that
one does less work when AC matching is involved.  The other alternative is to
work with a stack of environments instead of a flat environment, and push the
current environment when entering a block and pop it when exiting it.  This
way, one does more work when accessing variables (since one has to search the
variable in the environment stack in a top-down manner), but on the other hand
uses smaller environments and the definition gets closer to an implementation.
Based on experience with dozens of language semantics and other <strong>K</strong> definitions,
we have found that our approach above is the best trade-off between elegance
and efficiency (especially since rewrite engines have built-in techniques to
lazily copy terms, by need, thus not creating unnecessary copies),
so it is the one that we follow in general.</p>
<h2>Sequential composition</h2>
<p>Sequential composition is desugared into <strong>K</strong>&apos;s builtin sequentialization
operation (recall that, like in C, the semi-colon <code>;</code> is not a
statement separator in SIMPLE &#x2014; it is either a statement terminator or a
construct for a statement from an expression).  The rule below is
structural, so it does not count as a computational step.  One can make it
computational if one wants it to count as a step.  Note that <strong>K</strong> allows
to define the semantics of SIMPLE in such a way that statements eventually
dissolve from the top of the computation when they are completed; this is in
sharp contrast to (artificially) <code>evaluating</code> them to a special
<code>skip</code> statement value and then getting rid of that special value, as
it is the case in other semantic approaches (where everything must evaluate
to something).  This means that once <code>S&#x2081;</code> completes in the rule below, <code>S&#x2082;</code>
becomes automatically the next computation item without any additional
(explicit or implicit) rules.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> S1:Stmts S2:Stmts =&gt; S1 ~&gt; S2  [<span class="hljs-literal">structural</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>A subtle aspect of the rule above is that <code>S&#x2081;</code> is declared to have sort
<code>Stmts</code> and not <code>Stmt</code>.  That is because desugaring macros can indeed
produce left associative sequential composition of statements.  For example,
the code <code>var x=0; x=1;</code> is desugared to
<code>(var x; x=0;) x=1;</code>, so although originally the first term of
the sequential composition had sort <code>Stmt</code>, after desugaring it became
of sort <code>Stmts</code>.  Note that the attribute <code>[right]</code> associated
to the sequential compositon production is an attribute of the syntax, and not
of the semantics: e.g., it tells the parser to parse
<code>var x; x=0; x=1;</code> as <code>var x; (x=0; x=1;)</code>, but it
does not tell the rewrite engine to rewrite <code>(var x; x=0;) x=1;</code> to
<code>var x; (x=0; x=1;)</code>.</p>
<h2>Expression statements</h2>
<p>Expression statements are only used for their side effects, so their result
value is simply discarded.  Common examples of expression statements are ones
of the form <code>++x;</code>, <code>x=e;</code>, <code>e1[e2]=e3;</code>, etc.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> _:Val; =&gt; .
</code></pre>
<h2>Conditional</h2>
<p>Since the conditional was declared with the <code>strict(1)</code> attribute, we
can assume that its first argument will eventually be evaluated.  The rules
below cover the only two possibilities in which the conditional is allowed to
proceed (otherwise the rewriting process gets stuck).</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> if ( true) S else _ =&gt; S<span class="hljs-keyword">
  rule</span> if (false) _ else S =&gt; S
</code></pre>
<h2>While loop</h2>
<p>The simplest way to give the semantics of the while loop is by unrolling.
Note, however, that its unrolling is only allowed when the while loop reaches
the top of the computation (to avoid non-termination of unrolling).  We prefer
the rule below to be structural, because we don&apos;t want the unrolling of the
while loop to count as a computational step; this is unavoidable in
conventional semantics, but it is possible in <strong>K</strong> thanks to its distinction
between structural and computational rules.  The simple while loop semantics
below works because our while loops in SIMPLE are indeed very basic.  If we
allowed break/continue of loops then we would need a completely different
semantics, which would also involve the <code>control</code> cell.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> while (E) S =&gt; if (E) {S while(E)S}  [<span class="hljs-literal">structural</span>]
</code></pre>
<h2>Print</h2>
<p>The <code>print</code> statement was strict, so all its arguments are now
evaluated (recall that <code>print</code> is variadic).  We append each of
its evaluated arguments to the output buffer, and discard the residual
<code>print</code> statement with an empty list of arguments.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; print(V:Val, Es =&gt; Es); ...&lt;/k&gt; &lt;output&gt;... .List =&gt; ListItem(V) &lt;/output&gt;
    [print]<span class="hljs-keyword">
  rule</span> print(.Vals); =&gt; .  [<span class="hljs-literal">structural</span>]
</code></pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>SIMPLE allows parametric exceptions, in that one can throw and catch a
particular value.  The statement <code>try S&#x2081; catch(X) S&#x2082;</code>
proceeds with the evaluation of <code>S&#x2081;</code>.  If <code>S&#x2081;</code> evaluates normally, i.e.,
without any exception thrown, then <code>S&#x2082;</code> is discarded and the execution
continues normally.  If <code>S&#x2081;</code> throws an exception with a statement of the
form <code>throw E</code>, then <code>E</code> is first evaluated to some value <code>V</code>
(<code>throw</code> was declared to be strict), then <code>V</code> is bound to <code>X</code>, then
<code>S&#x2082;</code> is evaluated in the new environment while the reminder of <code>S&#x2081;</code> is
discarded, then the environment is recovered and the execution continues
normally with the statement following the <code>try S&#x2081; catch(X) S&#x2082;</code> statement.
Exceptions can be nested and the statements in the
<code>catch</code> part (<code>S&#x2082;</code> in our case) can throw exceptions to the
upper level.  One should be careful with how one handles the control data
structures here, so that the abrupt changes of control due to exception
throwing and to function returns interact correctly with each other.
For example, we want to allow function calls inside the statement <code>S&#x2081;</code> in
a <code>try S&#x2081; catch(X) S&#x2082;</code> block which can throw an exception
that is not caught by the function but instead is propagated to the
<code>try S&#x2081; catch(X) S&#x2082;</code> block that called the function.
Therefore, we have to make sure that the function stack as well as other
potential control structures are also properly modified when the exception
is thrown to correctly recover the execution context.  This can be easily
achieved by pushing/popping the entire current control context onto the
exception stack.  The three rules below modularly do precisely the above.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  syntax</span> KItem ::= (<span class="hljs-keyword">Id</span>,Stmts,K,Map,ControlCellFragment)<span class="hljs-keyword">

  syntax</span> KItem ::= <span class="hljs-string">&quot;popx&quot;</span><span class="hljs-keyword">

  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; (try S1 catch(X) {S2} =&gt; S1 ~&gt; popx) ~&gt; K &lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;control&gt;
         &lt;xstack&gt; .List =&gt; ListItem((X, S2, K, Env, C)) ...&lt;/xstack&gt;
         C
       &lt;/control&gt;
       &lt;env&gt; Env &lt;/env&gt;<span class="hljs-keyword">

  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; popx =&gt; . ...&lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;xstack&gt; ListItem(_) =&gt; .List ...&lt;/xstack&gt;<span class="hljs-keyword">

  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; throw V:Val; ~&gt; _ =&gt; { var X = V; S2 } ~&gt; K &lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;control&gt;
         &lt;xstack&gt; ListItem((X, S2, K, Env, C)) =&gt; .List ...&lt;/xstack&gt;
         (_ =&gt; C)
       &lt;/control&gt;
       &lt;env&gt; _ =&gt; Env &lt;/env&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The catch statement <code>S&#x2082;</code> needs to be executed in the original environment,
but where the thrown value <code>V</code> is bound to the catch variable <code>X</code>.  We here
chose to rely on two previously defined constructs when giving semantics to
the catch part of the statement: (1) the variable declaration with
initialization, for binding <code>X</code> to <code>V</code>; and (2) the block construct for
preventing <code>X</code> from shadowing variables in the original environment upon the
completion of <code>S&#x2082;</code>.</p>
<h2>Threads</h2>
<p>SIMPLE&apos;s threads can be created and terminated dynamically, and can
synchronize by acquiring and releasing re-entrant locks and by rendezvous.
We discuss the seven rules giving the semantics of these operations below.</p>
<h2>Thread creation</h2>
<p>Threads can be created by any other threads using the <code>spawn S</code>
construct.  The spawn expression construct evaluates to the unique identifier
of the newly created thread and, at the same time, a new thread cell is added
into the configuration, initialized with the <code>S</code> statement and sharing the
same environment with the parent thread.  Note that the newly created
<code>thread</code> cell is torn.  That means that the remaining cells are added
and initialized automatically as described in the definition of SIMPLE&apos;s
configuration.  This is part of <strong>K</strong>&apos;s configuration abstraction mechanism.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> &lt;thread&gt;...
         &lt;k&gt; spawn S =&gt; !T:<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span> ...&lt;/k&gt;
         &lt;env&gt; Env &lt;/env&gt;
       ...&lt;/thread&gt;
       (.Bag =&gt; &lt;thread&gt;...
               &lt;k&gt; S &lt;/k&gt;
               &lt;env&gt; Env &lt;/env&gt;
               &lt;id&gt; !T &lt;/id&gt;
             ...&lt;/thread&gt;)
</code></pre>
<h2>Thread termination</h2>
<p>Dually to the above, when a thread terminates its assigned computation (the
contents of its <code>k</code> cell) is empty, so the thread can be dissolved.
However, since no discipline is imposed on how locks are acquired and released,
it can be the case that a terminating thread still holds locks.  Those locks
must be released, so other threads attempting to acquire them do not deadlock.
We achieve that by removing all the locks held by the terminating thread in its
<code>holds</code> cell from the set of busy locks in the <code>busy</code> cell
(<code>keys(H)</code> returns the domain of the map <code>H</code> as a set, that is, only
the locks themselves ignoring their multiplicity).  As seen below, a lock is
added to the <code>busy</code> cell as soon as it is acquired for the first time
by a thread.  The unique identifier of the terminated thread is also collected
into the <code>terminated</code> cell, so the <code>join</code> construct knows which
threads have terminated.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> (&lt;thread&gt;... &lt;k&gt;.&lt;/k&gt; &lt;holds&gt;H&lt;/holds&gt; &lt;id&gt;T&lt;/id&gt; ...&lt;/thread&gt; =&gt; .Bag)
       &lt;busy&gt; Busy =&gt; Busy -Set keys(H) &lt;/busy&gt;
       &lt;terminated&gt;... .Set =&gt; SetItem(T) ...&lt;/terminated&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Thread joining</h2>
<p>Thread joining is now straightforward: all we need to do is to check whether
the identifier of the thread to be joined is in the <code>terminated</code> cell.
If yes, then the <code>join</code> statement dissolves and the joining thread
continues normally; if not, then the joining thread gets stuck.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; join T:<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span>; =&gt; . ...&lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;terminated&gt;... SetItem(T) ...&lt;/terminated&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Acquire lock</h2>
<p>There are two cases to distinguish when a thread attempts to acquire a lock
(in SIMPLE any value can be used as a lock):<br>
(1) The thread does not currently have the lock, in which case it has to
take it provided that the lock is not already taken by another thread (see
the side condition of the first rule).<br>
(2) The thread already has the lock, in which case it just increments its
counter for the lock (the locks are re-entrant).  These two cases are captured
by the two rules below:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; acquire V:Val; =&gt; . ...&lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;holds&gt;... .Map =&gt; V |-&gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span> ...&lt;/holds&gt;
       &lt;busy&gt; Busy (.Set =&gt; SetItem(V)) &lt;/busy&gt;<span class="hljs-keyword">
    requires</span> (notBool(V in Busy))  [acquire]<span class="hljs-keyword">

  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; acquire V; =&gt; . ...&lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;holds&gt;... V:Val |-&gt; (N =&gt; N +<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) ...&lt;/holds&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Release lock</h2>
<p>Similarly, there are two corresponding cases to distinguish when a thread
releases a lock:<br>
(1) The thread holds the lock more than once, in which case all it needs to do
is to decrement the lock counter.<br>
(2) The thread holds the lock only once, in which case it needs to remove it
from its <code>holds</code> cell and also from the the shared <code>busy</code> cell,
so other threads can acquire it if they need to.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; release V:Val; =&gt; . ...&lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;holds&gt;... V |-&gt; (N =&gt; N -<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) ...&lt;/holds&gt;<span class="hljs-keyword">
    requires</span> N &gt;<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span><span class="hljs-keyword">

  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; release V; =&gt; . ...&lt;/k&gt; &lt;holds&gt;... V:Val |-&gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span> =&gt; .Map ...&lt;/holds&gt;
       &lt;busy&gt;... SetItem(V) =&gt; .Set ...&lt;/busy&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Rendezvous synchronization</h2>
<p>In addition to synchronization through acquire and release of locks, SIMPLE
also provides a construct for rendezvous synchronization.  A thread whose next
statement to execute is <code>rendezvous(V)</code> gets stuck until another
thread reaches an identical statement; when that happens, the two threads
drop their rendezvous statements and continue their executions.  If three
threads happen to have an identical rendezvous statement as their next
statement, then precisely two of them will synchronize and the other will
remain blocked until another thread reaches a similar rendezvous statement.
The rule below is as simple as it can be.  Note, however, that, again, it is
<strong>K</strong>&apos;s mechanism for configuration abstraction that makes it work as desired:
since the only cell which can multiply containing a <code>k</code> cell inside is
the <code>thread</code> cell, the only way to concretize the rule below to the
actual configuration of SIMPLE is to include each <code>k</code> cell in a
<code>thread</code> cell.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; rendezvous V:Val; =&gt; . ...&lt;/k&gt;
       &lt;k&gt; rendezvous V; =&gt; . ...&lt;/k&gt;  [rendezvous]
</code></pre>
<h2>Auxiliary declarations and operations</h2>
<p>In this section we define all the auxiliary constructs used in the
above semantics.</p>
<h2>Making declarations</h2>
<p>The <code>mkDecls</code> auxiliary construct turns a list of identifiers
and a list of values in a sequence of corresponding variable
declarations.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  syntax</span> Stmts ::= mkDecls(Ids,Vals)  [function]<span class="hljs-keyword">
  rule</span> mkDecls((X:<span class="hljs-keyword">Id</span>, Xs:Ids), (V:Val, Vs:Vals)) =&gt; var X=V; mkDecls(Xs,Vs)<span class="hljs-keyword">
  rule</span> mkDecls(.Ids,.Vals) =&gt; {}
</code></pre>
<h2>Location lookup</h2>
<p>The operation below is straightforward.  Note that we tag it with the same
<code>lookup</code> tag as the variable lookup rule defined above.  This way,
both rules will be considered transitions when we include the <code>lookup</code>
tag in the transition option of <code>kompile</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  syntax</span> Exp ::= lookup(<span class="hljs-keyword">Int</span>)<span class="hljs-keyword">
  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; lookup(L) =&gt; V ...&lt;/k&gt; &lt;store&gt;... L |-&gt; V:Val ...&lt;/store&gt;  [lookup]
</code></pre>
<h2>Environment recovery</h2>
<p>We have already discussed the environment recovery auxiliary operation in the
IMP++ tutorial:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">// <span class="hljs-doctag">TODO:</span> eliminate the env wrapper, like we did in IMP++</span><span class="hljs-keyword">

  syntax</span> KItem ::= setEnv(Map)<span class="hljs-keyword">
  rule</span> &lt;k&gt; setEnv(Env) =&gt; . ...&lt;/k&gt; &lt;env&gt; _ =&gt; Env &lt;/env&gt;  [<span class="hljs-literal">structural</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>While theoretically sufficient, the basic definition for environment
recovery alone is suboptimal.  Consider a loop <code>while (E)S</code>,
whose semantics (see above) was given by unrolling.  <code>S</code>
is a block.  Then the semantics of blocks above, together with the
unrolling semantics of the while loop, will yield a computation
structure in the <code>k</code> cell that increasingly grows, adding a new
environment recovery task right in front of the already existing sequence of
similar environment recovery tasks (this phenomenon is similar to the ``tail
recursion&apos;&apos; problem).  Of course, when we have a sequence of environment
recovery tasks, we only need to keep the last one.  The elegant rule below
does precisely that, thus avoiding the unnecessary computation explosion
problem:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">  rule</span> (setEnv(_) =&gt; .) ~&gt; setEnv(_)  [<span class="hljs-literal">structural</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, the above follows a common convention in <strong>K</strong> for recovery
operations of cell contents: the meaning of a computation task of the form
<code>cell(C)</code> that reaches the top of the computation is that the current
contents of cell <code>cell</code> is discarded and gets replaced with <code>C</code>.  We
did not add support for these special computation tasks in our current
implementation of <strong>K</strong>, so we need to define them as above.</p>
<h2>lvalue and loc</h2>
<p>For convenience in giving the semantics of constructs like the increment and
the assignment, that we want to operate the same way on variables and on
array elements, we used an auxiliary <code>lvalue(E)</code> construct which was
expected to evaluate to the lvalue of the expression <code>E</code>.  This is only
defined when <code>E</code> has an lvalue, that is, when <code>E</code> is either a variable or
evaluates to an array element.  <code>lvalue(E)</code> evaluates to a value of
the form <code>loc(L)</code>, where <code>L</code> is the location where the value of <code>E</code>
can be found; for clarity, we use <code>loc</code> to structurally distinguish
natural numbers from location values.  In giving semantics to <code>lvalue</code>
there are two cases to consider.  (1) If <code>E</code> is a variable, then all we need
to do is to grab its location from the environment.  (2) If <code>E</code> is an array
element, then we first evaluate the array and its index in order to identify
the exact location of the element of concern, and then return that location;
the last rule below works because its preceding context declarations ensure
that the array and its index are evaluated, and then the rule for array lookup
(defined above) rewrites the evaluated array access construct to its
corresponding store lookup operation.</p>

<p>The semantics of SIMPLE is now complete.  Make sure you kompile the
definition with the right options in order to generate the desired model.
No kompile options are needed if you only only want to execute the definition
(and thus get an interpreter), but if you want to search for a different
program behaviors then you need to kompile with the transition option
including rule tags such as lookup, increment, acquire, etc.  See the
IMP++ tutorial for what the transition option means how to use it.</p>
