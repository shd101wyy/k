          <h1>K</h1>
          <p>
            is a rewrite-based executable semantic framework in which
            programming languages, type systems and formal analysis tools can be
            defined using configurations, computations and rules. Configurations
            organize the state in units called cells, which are labeled and can
            be nested. Computations carry computational meaning as special
            nested list structures sequentializing computational tasks, such as
            fragments of program. Computations extend the original language
            abstract syntax. K (rewrite) rules make it explicit which parts of
            the term they read-only, write-only, read-write, or do not care
            about. This makes K suitable for defining truly concurrent languages
            even in the presence of sharing. Computations are like any other
            terms in a rewriting environment: they can be matched, moved from
            one place to another, modified, or deleted. This makes K suitable
            for defining control-intensive features such as abrupt termination,
            exceptions or call/cc.
