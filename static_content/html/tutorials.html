          <h1>K Tutorial</h1>
          <p>
            Here you will learn how to use the K tool to define languages by
            means of a series of screencast movies. It is recommended to do
            these in the indicated order, because K features already discussed
            in a previous language definition will likely not be rediscussed in
            latter definitions. The screencasts follow quite closely the
            structure of the files under the
            <a
              href="https://github.com/kframework/k/tree/master/k-distribution/tutorial"
              >tutorial folder</a
            >
            in the K tool distribution. If you'd rather follow the instructions
            there and do the tutorial exercises yourself, then go back to
            <a href="http://kframework.org/">http://kframework.org</a> and
            download the K tool, if you have not done it already. Or, you can
            first watch the screencasts below and then do the exercises, or do
            them in parallel.
          </p>
          <h2>K Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Make sure you watch the K overview video before you do the K
            tutorial:

          <h2>Learning K</h2>
          <h3>[34'46"] Part 1: Defining LAMBDA</h3>
          <p>
            Here you will learn how to define a very simple functional language
            in K and the basics of how to use the K tool. The language is a
            call-by-value variant of lambda calculus with builtins and mu, and
            its definition is based on substitution.
